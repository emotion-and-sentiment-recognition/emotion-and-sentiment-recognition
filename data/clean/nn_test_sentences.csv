znany i ceniony sieć hotel iberostar mieć być nadzieja że będe zadowolona z wybór . niestety hotel okazać się totalny pomyłka . jezeli wakacje kosztowalyb 2 tysiąc złoty pewien fakt można by przemilczeć ale za kwota jaki się płacić za ten hotel otrzymować się bardzo słabą jakość . hotel niby nowy ale widać że się już troche zużyć . do plaza być niedaleko ale nie być to tak z znajdować się bezposrednio przy on . hotel od centrum miejscowosci być dosc sporo oddalon wiec malo tam się dziać . atrakcja w hotel żaden , animacja wołać o pomsta do niebo . może dla senior okej ale dla młody człowiek niestety nie . basen dosc małyio leżak teza nie być za wiele . do pokój nie mieć się co czepiać tylko problem być z klimatyzacja , ktora hotel w konkretny godzina wyłączać tłumaczyć się ochrona środowisko . najgorszym punkt hotel być restauracja , który być za mały i często brakować wolny stolik . absurdalne być też to , że nie można być często usiąść do konkretny stolik poniewaz obslugać siebie przygotować ten stolik na kolejny posiłek , na śniadanie już siebie przygotowywać na lunch , na lunch na kolacja i tak dalej . co do jedzenie to tu być bardzo zawiedziyć . mały wybór posiłek , zero urozmaicenie , codziennie to sam . często bywać tak z na śniadanie nie byo po prosty co zjeść a na kolejny posiłke dobry co być to pizza . kawa , herbata i sok można być tylko się napic do sniadać , do kolejny posiłek ekspres i automat z sok być pozasłaniać . zastanawiać się dlaczego hotel mieć tak wysoki cena za pobyt skoro nie wiele dobry można o on powiedzieć . majorka być piękny

ten bateria od niedawny . wykonać solidny , chociaż niestety , jak w większość bateria z ten półka cenowy plastikowy wylewka ( co prawda całkiem nieźle wykonać i na pierwszy rzut oko nie widać , ani nie czuć w dotyk - trochę za lekki jak na metal ) . posiadać ruchomy wylewka . nie chlapać i nawet przy zmiana strumień woda na prysznic rozprysk woda być niewielki . bateria prezentować się efektownie , a wąż pod sprężyna być metalowy , co nie często się zdarzać . zaletą być jeszcze to , że dźwignie otwierać woda móc być zarówno z przód , jak i z prawy lub lewy strona . łatwa w utrzymanie czystość , zgrabny ( nie być wielki 46 centymetr wysokość inny maj powyżej 55 centymetr ) a z zlew tek astral ( z tegranitu onyks ) pięknie się prezentować na tło okno w mój kuchnia . być

wrócić być z wakacje w ten hotel i po przeanalizować cały pobyt móc z czysty sumieniem stwierdzić , iż hotel nie zasługiwać na 5 gwiazdek co najwyżej na mocny 3,5 gwiazdka ( sam obsługa w rozmowa przyznawać , że być to hotel 4 gwiazdkowy).pokój czysty zadbać sprzątać codziennie . jedyny minus być zablokować klimatyzacja ( sterować centralnie – można on tylko włączyć i wyłączyć ) . brak też dvd , który zgodnie z opis być w pokój ( my to nie przeszkadzać bo urlop też należeć się od telewizji).basena znajduć się w hotel być niewielki za to z znaczny ilość chlor . wyżywienieśniadanie monotonny ale jak w większość hotel . obiad serwować w główny restauracja jak ktoś lubić fastfood to około ( zawsze frytka , peree , brak kasz , ryżu . ) . menu powtarzać się czyli , kurczak , spagethii , zapiekanka i tym podobne . codziennie . plusem być duży wybór sałatka i dojrzały owoc ( pomarańczy , arbuz , melona , wiśnia , truskawka , brzoskwinia , banan , jabłko , sałatka owocowa).kolacja powtórek danie z obiad tylko z niewielki modyfikacja . to co nie zostać zjedzć podczas obiad być przetwarzać i podawać jeszcze raz ( z jeden strona nie marnować się jedzenie , ale jak na hotel niby 5 gwiazdkowy to taki rzecz nie powinien mieć raczej miejsce ) . kolacja tematyczny na który trzeba się zapisać w recepcja tez żaden rewelacja – ponieważ być serwować to sam co w główny restauracja . czy być to kolacja włoski , barbecue czy grecki to tak naprawdę nic się nie różnić . kącik jedzenie dla dziecko być widać – ale osobiście widzieć być tam jeść tylko raz dla dziecko podczas tygodniowy pobyt i być to sam co dla dorosły . aqua park to chyba przez on podniesiić być standard hotel do 5 gwiazdek . zjeżdżalnie super bardzo bezpieczny . obsługa rygorystycznie przestrzegać wzrost dziecko , który móc skorzystać z dany atrakcja . rwąca rzeka fajny , ale nie polecać z on korzystać od raz od otwarcie , ponieważ widzieć być jak rano wlewać z duży kanistr chlor , zapach nieprzyjemny , więc niech ten chlor się wymieszać choć trochę z woda . jedzenie w bar dobry choć czas ciasto pizzy z bardzo duży ilość drożdży . proście o ciepły frytka dobrze wydawać prosto z kuchnia , ponieważ ten przy
